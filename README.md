# MOSFET Inverter Loss Modelling under SVPWM with Experimental Validation

## Overview
This project focuses on analytical modelling and experimental validation of conduction and switching losses in a three-phase MOSFET-based Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) operating under Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM).

The objective is to improve accuracy of semiconductor loss estimation by comparing analytical calculations with practical measurements under static RL load conditions.
